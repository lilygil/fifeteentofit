           I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and NASM certified personal trainer. Fitness has always played a significant role in my life. I started out playing competitive sports in middle school, before discovering a love for rock-climbing, running, and yoga in high school. Since then, I have eagerly attempted everything from aerial silk yoga and barre classes, to boxing and crossfit (some of which will remain a one-time experience). Two summers ago, I decided it was time to get certified as a personal trainer, to begin helping others find a love for fitness. </p>
           <p>My greatest passion in life is to help people. Whether you are new to working out, are getting back into it after a hiatus, or want to up your fitness level, I would love to join you on your fitness journey! I have found that the only way to maintain a fitness regimen is to keep it fun and exciting. I love to change up my own workouts, and look forward to keeping you challenged and having a good time!</p>
           <p>In addition to exploring new fitness classes, I stay active by hiking with my 3.5 legged Golden Retriever, running, rock-climbing, and trying out my own HIIT workouts.</p>
